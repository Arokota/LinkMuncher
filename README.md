# Link-Muncher
Author: @arokota

Simply input the link that you wish to have shortened and then pick the service you would like to use to do this.

This command line application makes it easier to use those url-shortening aplications on the fly, instead of opening up a browser.

## Dependencies

`pip3 install pyshorteners`
